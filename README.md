# vmboot

This repo is a clone from the [https://github.com/holmanb/vmboot.git](https://github.com/holmanb/vmboot.git) as part of work to use Ansible playbooks with cloud-init. It will be drastically changed to accommodate the repo's owner's requirements.

cloud-init, while handy, is not very flexible, is hard to troubleshoot and leads to bizarre behaviour on the host.
