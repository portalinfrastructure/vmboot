# vmboot

This repo is a clone from Brett Holman's [https://github.com/holmanb/vmboot.git](https://github.com/holmanb/vmboot.git) repo as part of work to use Ansible playbooks with cloud-init. It will be drastically changed to accommodate the repo's owner's requirements.

The link to [https://github.com/holmanb/vmboot.git](https://github.com/holmanb/vmboot.git) comes from cloud-init ansible module documentation at [https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/modules.html#ansible](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/modules.html#ansible)

cloud-init, while handy, is not very flexible, is hard to troubleshoot and leads to bizarre behaviour on the host.
